# Kanban

This is a sample Kanban Board application built as an Internet Computer Canister using TypeScript.

You can create, update and delete Kanban Cards.

Each Kanban Card has these properties: description, assignee, deadline and stage.

You can create, update and delete Stage transition rules to prohibit certain transitions, e.g. from "Requested" to "Done".

You can also query Kanban Cards by ID, assignee and stage.
